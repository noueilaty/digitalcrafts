    <h4>The Fundamentals of Programming in Python</h4>

    <p>The first thing taught in nearly any programming curriculum is how to print something to the console. Most commonly the phrase is 'Hello World'. Each programming language has its own syntax to do so, but here's what it looks like for Python:
      <pre>
    print('Hello World')
      </pre>
    The 'print' is called a method, which is esentially pre-programmed instructions that come as part of the language, in this case Python. So one would read the code as, "Combine what's in the open and close parenthesis and print it to the console. The result is this:
      <pre>
    Hello World
      </pre>
