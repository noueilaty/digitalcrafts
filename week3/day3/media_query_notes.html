<!--
Media Query in two ways:
1. Create a separate mobile website (different source code entirely). Sometimes handled by two separate teams (desktop and mobile development teams)
2. Responsive design: 1 codebase, 1 team, working with one folder in one repository.


Notes:
Consider using 'em' instead of 'px' for mobile development.
